							The Fire Noodle Challenge was started in February 2014 by popular YouTuber “영국남자 Korean Englishman”.

After receiving mail from fans, Josh (the YouTuber) noticed that many of the mailed packages contained “Fire Chicken Noodles”.

Soon after receiving the noodles, Josh challenged some of his friends in the UK to finish a serving.

Being a YouTuber the cameras were rolling and Josh captured viral video gold as he and his friends tried to make their way through the spicy noodles.

Once the video was edited, Josh uploaded it onto YouTube and thus began the Fire Noodle Challenge!



If you’re looking to try the Fire Noodle Challenge yourself, you will need to get your hands on the noodles first.

Due to the popularity of Korean fire noodles, it has become easier and easier to find the packages at local Asian markets and online.
